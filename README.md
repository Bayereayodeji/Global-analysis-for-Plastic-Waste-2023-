# Global-analysis-for-Plastic-Waste-2023-
I conducted a comprehensive ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL PLASTIC WASTE FOR 2023

As part of my learning journey in data analytics at Vephla University's Data School, I conducted a comprehensive ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL PLASTIC WASTE FOR 2023. The dataset covers 165 countries and evaluates various aspects of plastic waste production, recycling efficiency, and environmental risks. This report outlines the key insights derived from the analysis and offers recommendations for addressing the challenges identified.


KEY INSIGHTS
1.	Top Per Capita Waste by Source:
Source: Consumer Packaging
Volume: 14.6K kg (77.35% of total waste)

2.	Top Per Capita Waste by Country:
Country: Iceland
Per Capita Waste: 1564 kg
Sum Total Waste: 20.17K kg

3.	Country with the Highest Plastic Waste:
Country: China
Volume: 59.08K kg (out of 284.38K total)

4.	Country with the Lowest Plastic Waste:
Country: Brazil
Volume: 6K kg (out of 284.38K total)

5.	Top Country for Recycling Rate:
Country: Japan
Rate: 85 (out of 2.16K total)

6.	Countries with the Lowest Recycling Rate:
Countries: Germany & Brazil
Rate: 6 each (out of 2.16K total)

7.	Top Recycling Rate by Main Source:
Source: Consumer Packaging
Volume: 934 (out of 2.16K total)

8.	Least Recycling Rate by Main Source:
Source: Consumer Goods
Volume: 12 (out of 2.16K total)

9.	Top Coastal Plastic Waste Risk:
Category: High
Volume: 125K kg (out of 284.38K total)

10.	Least Coastal Plastic Waste Risk:
Category: Very High
Volume: 10K kg (out of 284.38K total)

ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
The analysis highlights significant disparities in plastic waste generation, recycling rates, and environmental risk levels across countries. Key concerns include:

•	Dominance of Consumer Packaging: It is the largest contributor to both waste production and recycling efforts.

•	Recycling Challenges: While Japan demonstrates high recycling efficiency, other major economies like Germany and Brazil lag significantly.

•	Environmental Risks: Coastal regions with "High" waste risk highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the insights, the following actions are recommended:
1.	Promote Sustainable Consumer Packaging:

o	Encourage the adoption of biodegradable or reusable packaging materials.

o	Implement policies to reduce excessive packaging, especially in high-waste countries.

2.	Strengthen Recycling Programs:

o	Introduce incentives for improving recycling rates, particularly in countries with low performance like Germany and Brazil.

o	Facilitate technology transfers to enhance recycling infrastructure globally.

3.	Target High-Risk Coastal Regions:

o	Develop stringent waste management protocols for coastal areas categorized as "High" risk.

o	Support international initiatives focused on reducing marine plastic pollution.

4.	Public Awareness and Education:

o	Conduct campaigns to promote responsible consumption and waste segregation.

o	Engage communities in collaborative recycling initiatives.

5.	Global Collaboration and Funding:

o	Encourage partnerships between governments, private organizations, and NGOs to address plastic waste collectively.

o	Allocate funding for research on innovative recycling technologies and alternative materials.

Conclusion
This analysis underscores the urgent need for coordinated efforts to mitigate the environmental impacts of plastic waste. By leveraging insights from data analytics, stakeholders can design targeted interventions to promote sustainability and safeguard the environment.
